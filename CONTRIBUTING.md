- [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
- [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
- [Git Guidelines](#git-guidelines)
- [Release Process (for internal team only)](#release-process-for-internal-team-only)

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)(PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the MeiliSearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [MeiliSearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-kubernetes/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-kubernetes/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-kubernetes repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-kubernetes repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-kubernetes/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Setup <!-- omit in toc -->

In order to use the different tools on this repository, you will first need to:

- [Install Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) on your machine. This will allow you to run commands against your Kubernetes cluster with the `kubectl` command.

- [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). This will allow you to run the `helm` command, enabling the installation and manipulation of Helm charts.

- A Kubernetes cluster up and running. Any Kubernetes cluster can be used, on the cloud or locally installed on your machine. This can be easily achieved by [installing minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), and creating a local cluster by running:

```bash
minikube start
```

You can install and test the Helm chart by running:

```bash
helm install meilisearch-chart-test -f charts/meilisearch/values.yaml charts/meilisearch
```

An easy way to access your MeiliSearch instance and test that it is up and running is by using port-forwarding. This can be achieved by running:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/meilisearch 7700:7700
```

Finally, to uninstall the chart, run:

```bash
helm uninstall meilisearch-chart-test 
```

### Tests and Linter <!-- omit in toc -->


Each PR should pass the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# Linter
helm lint charts/meilisearch 
```

Additionally, the GitHub CI will run a test to check if there are changes introduced to the charts. If changes were introduced, it will require you to update the Chart version.

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in toc -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in toc -->

We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in toc -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in toc -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-kubernetes/releases/).

## Release Process (for internal team only)

MeiliSearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automation to Rebase and Merge the PRs <!-- omit in toc -->

This project integrates a bot that helps us manage pull requests merging.<br>

### How to Publish the Release <!-- omit in toc -->

⚠️ Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/integration-release.md).

⚠️ Every PR that is merged to `main` introducing changes to the Helm Chart needs to modify the file [`charts/meilisearch/Chart.yaml`](charts/meilisearch/Chart.yaml), by increasing the version of the chart accordingly.

Every PR that is merged to `main` triggers the automated release process, as specified at [`.github/workflows/release-chart.yaml`](.github/workflows/release-chart.yaml). A GitHub Action will be triggered and publish a new release on the GitHub repository [releases](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-kubernetes/releases). This will enable users to start using the new version of the chart immediately after publishing.
